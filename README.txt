(you can do 'make debug' for a debug build)


Make sure you don't run 'make clean' or 'make distclean' as this will
delete bison/flex files and require additional dependencies on the
correct version of bison/flex. If you did that, you have to copy
'*.save' files to the corresponding files without '.save' extension or untar
the archive and start again.

Add the following line at the end of ~/.bash_profile
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/qwt-5.2.1/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Then execute '. .bash_profile'. Make sure the path is set correctly: 
'echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH'

For development only:
cp $VTK_BINARY_DIR/bin/libQVTKWidgetPlugin.so $QTDIR/plugins/designer


Mac OS X Snow Leopard
---------------------
Install XCode 3.2.6 (search for 'Xcode snow leopard')


Windows - not up to date.
-------------------------
Install cygwin, making sure you select openssh, subversion, perl, bison, flex

Run
===
./foam ~/Documents/swansea-phd/foam/ctrctn/dump_0.1520_0.2400_8.0000_0*.dmp

To skip some files in the simulation (to save memory) use:
~/Documents/swansea-phd/foam/ctrctn/dump_0.1520_0.2400_8.0000_0??[012345678].dmp

loads files 0, 1, ..., 8 and skips 9. You can skip more files by
removing more digits between the square brackets.

Execute ./foam without any parameters to see a list of options.

Command lines for various datasets:
-----------------------------------
See simulations.ini.


Generate a movie
================
Check 'Save movie' check box.
Interact with the program
./movie.sh
This will generate a file called 'foamMovie.mp4'


Debug - Profile (gprof)
=======================
Install: gprof

Add the following options to foam.pro:
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -pg
QMAKE_LFLAGS += -pg

Recompile the program:
make distclean;qmake;make -j 4;

Run the program:
./foam ~/Documents/swansea-phd/foam/ctrctndumps_704v_0.1520_0.2400_8.0000_v1 dump_0.1520_0.2400_8.0000_00*.dmp

Run gprof on the generated file (gmon.out), eventually selecting some
files of interest (to profile only functions from those files):
gprof ./foam_debug > gprof.txt
or
gprof -pFoamAlongTime.cpp -qFoamAlongTime.cpp ./foam_debug > gprof.txt
-p generates a flat profile
-q generates a call graph
See gprof.info for information on gprof.txt.

Debug - static checks (cppcheck)
================================
cppcheck-gui will use the project file foamvis.cppcheck and 


Debug - Memory leaks, ... (valgrind)
====================================
valgrind --suppressions=valgrind-supressions.txt --leak-check=yes
./foam ~/Documents/swansea-phd/foam/coarse100/coarse_01_0100_4309.dmp

You can use the option '--gen-suppressions=yes' to print suppressions
to be added to 'valgrind-suppressions.txt'.

Debug - OpenGL (bugle, gldb-gui)
==============================
gldb-gui

Debug - Parser, Scanner
=======================
./foam --debug-parsing 2>error.txt
./foam --debug-scanning 2>error.txt
See error.txt, Evolver.y, Evolver.l and EvolverData.output for 
information on the parser and scanner

Debug - STL error messages
==========================
Copy the offending compilation command and replace 'g++' with 'gfilt'. 
It uses STLFilt tool that simplifies STL error messages.

Release log
===========
0.9.
        - isosurface added to the average view
        - added menu action: Copy > Selection > Value to Id. This allows the user
          to follow bubbles with high velocity. Select first bubbles with high 
          velocity in a time step, then copy the selection by value to a 
          selection by id and then remove the selection by value from the 
          histogram.

0.9.2826
        - add Reset transform/All and Focus to the VTK view (3D average)
        - color and overlay bars work in VTK view
        - velocity glyph visualization in the average view.
        - 3D T1s vis.
        - Velocity glyph visualization in the time step view.
        - you can specify ? and [0-9] filter.
        - add title to color bar in GL view.
        - moved T1s inside the original domain for 3D
        - set the peak height for gaussians to 1.0 for both 2D and 3D
        - fixed bug: resampling to a regular grid was done using a 
                     foam bounding box but averaging was done using a 
                     simulation box.
                     WARNING: saving and loading of the regular grid has to
                     be done with the same number of steps (the same simulation 
                     bounding box)
        - added parameter --simulation-box that specifies the simulation box
          for all time steps. This allows loading just a few time steps and
          having the regular grid correctly rendered.
        - voxels are square now (so that Gaussian is spheric)
        - t1s kde for 3D implemented
0.8.2740
        - update to vtk-6.0-20130125.tgz
        - remove folders inside .foamvis to regenerate regular grid data for 3D
        - bug fix: next step did not update the OpenGL window when both 
          VTK and OpenGL windows are displayed.
        - bug fix: when set average vis the program segfaults
        - bug fix: sometimes copy color bar creates a clamping that was 
          not in the source
        - added Copy / Selection to the VTK view        
        - adjust context alpha per view (before it was done for all views)
        - bug fix: copy selection crashes if the histogram was never open
        - bug fix: go-to-end button causes an exception
        - changed parameter format for --force such that it takes three 
          components for each force and the separator is comma.
        - Display forces for 3D average
        - bug fix: crash for comparing simulations with different number of 
          time steps.
        - Allowing loading/comparison of 2D and 3D simulations
        - Bug fix: save regular version of the dataset before adjusting 
          pressures and then adjust pressures when loading data from disk. 
          This is needed to allow loading different number of time steps for 
          different executions of the program.
        - Bug fix: copy selection works only for the same scalar or 
          selection by id.
        - Compute volume for 3D if it is not available in the DMP file
0.8.2699
        - bug fix: transformations are slow
        - allow keywords inside SCALAR_INTEGRANT (for shearv_35)
        - implement simple form of view transform

        - improved constraint processing speed by avoiding string lookups at 
          each access of a variable.
        - fix regression: deselected objects are not transparent
        - save cache files in ~/.foamvis instead of the original data folder.
        - warning message in automatically generaged fragment shaders
        - add color mapped streamlines (colored by velocity magnitude)
        - allow color map copy between T1s KDE with the same sigma 
          for different simulations.
        - added user option 'time interval' for bubble paths
        - Remove user options for T1sKDE: 
          'Texture Size', 'Interval / Pixel' and set them automatically 
          based on 'Sigma'. Sigma is expressed in terms of bubble size.
        - show streamlines and KDE together and seed based on KDE value
        - show  min, max and clamping values for the color map
        - extend the linked time option with multiple events
        - bug fix: scalar selection shown on the time bar
        - update to vtk-6.0-20121121.tgz (for pathlines).
