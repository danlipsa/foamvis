Release log
===========
1.0.
        - fixed bug where the color map from velocity was interfering with color
          map from T1KDE
        - fixed 2D T1KDE bug where the average is computed by dividing by the
          number of steps with a t1 instead of dividing by the total number of 
          time steps
1.0.2888 2013-05-14
        - isosurface added to the average view
        - added menu action: Copy > Selection > Value to Id. This allows the user
          to follow bubbles with high velocity. Select first bubbles with high 
          velocity in a time step, then copy the selection by value to a 
          selection by id and then remove the selection by value from the 
          histogram.
        - show torus domain in the average and t1kde views
        - show forces in scalar view.
        - copy transforms sets the scale such that the bubble size is the same
          in the two datasets.
        - Add Copy > Force ratio that sets up forces in two simulations so that
          are comparable on the screen.
        - Show T1s around a following object for all time steps.
0.9.2826 2013-04-18
        - add Reset transform/All and Focus to the VTK view (3D average)
        - color and overlay bars work in VTK view
        - velocity glyph visualization in the average view.
        - 3D T1s vis.
        - Velocity glyph visualization in the time step view.
        - you can specify ? and [0-9] filter.
        - add title to color bar in GL view.
        - moved T1s inside the original domain for 3D
        - set the peak height for gaussians to 1.0 for both 2D and 3D
        - fixed bug: resampling to a regular grid was done using a 
                     foam bounding box but averaging was done using a 
                     simulation box.
                     WARNING: saving and loading of the regular grid has to
                     be done with the same number of steps (the same simulation 
                     bounding box)
        - added parameter --simulation-box that specifies the simulation box
          for all time steps. This allows loading just a few time steps and
          having the regular grid correctly rendered.
        - voxels are square now (so that Gaussian is spheric)
        - t1s kde for 3D implemented
0.8.2740 2013-03-01
        - update to vtk-6.0-20130125.tgz

        - bug fix: next step did not update the OpenGL window when both 
          VTK and OpenGL windows are displayed.
        - bug fix: when set average vis the program segfaults
        - bug fix: sometimes copy color bar creates a clamping that was 
          not in the source
        - added Copy / Selection to the VTK view        
        - adjust context alpha per view (before it was done for all views)
        - bug fix: copy selection crashes if the histogram was never open
        - bug fix: go-to-end button causes an exception
        - changed parameter format for --force such that it takes three 
          components for each force and the separator is comma.
        - Display forces for 3D average
        - bug fix: crash for comparing simulations with different number of 
          time steps.
        - Allowing loading/comparison of 2D and 3D simulations
        - Bug fix: save regular version of the dataset before adjusting 
          pressures and then adjust pressures when loading data from disk. 
          This is needed to allow loading different number of time steps for 
          different executions of the program.
        - Bug fix: copy selection works only for the same scalar or 
          selection by id.
